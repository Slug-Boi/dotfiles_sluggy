# Automatically log out the current desktop session when switching GPUs.
# This feature is currently supported for the following DE/WM :
# GNOME, KDE Plasma, LXDE, Deepin, Xfce, i3, Openbox, AwesomeWM, bspwm and dwm
# If this option is disabled or you use a different desktop environment,
# GPU switching only becomes effective at the next graphical session login.
auto_logout=yes

# GPU mode to use at computer startup.
# Possible values: nvidia, integrated, hybrid, auto, intel (deprecated, equivalent to integrated)
# "auto" is a special mode that auto-detects if the computer is running on battery
# and selects a proper GPU mode. See the other options below.
startup_mode=nvidia
# GPU mode to select when startup_mode=auto and the computer is running on battery.
# Possible values: nvidia, integrated, hybrid, intel (deprecated, equivalent to integrated)
startup_auto_battery_mode=hybrid
# GPU mode to select when startup_mode=auto and the computer is running on external power.
# Possible values: nvidia, integrated, hybrid, intel (deprecated, equivalent to integrated)

[intel]
# Driver to use for the Intel GPU. Possible values : modesetting, intel
# To use the intel driver, you need to install the package "xf86-video-intel".
# NOTE: The intel driver seems to be pretty outdated, keeping this for now. But the intel driver may fix perfomance issues if there is anyone

[nvidia]

# Whether or not to enable modesetting. Required for PRIME Synchronization (which prevents tearing).
modeset=yes

# DPI value. This will be set using the Xsetup script passed to your login manager.
# It will run the command
# xrandr --dpi <DPI>
# Leave blank for the default (the above command will not be run).
# NOTE: Changed from 96
DPI=192


# Enable Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management in the Nvidia driver. While in hybrid mode,
# this feature allows the Nvidia card to go into a low-power mode if it's not in use.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - The feature is still experimental
# - It's only supported on laptops with a Turing GPU or above, and an Intel Coffee Lake CPU
# or above (not sure about the state of support for AMD CPUs).
# - if your Nvidia card also has an audio chip (for HDMI) or a USB port wired to it, they may not
# function properly while in low-power mode
#
# For more details, see
# https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/460.39/README/dynamicpowermanagement.html
#
# Available options:
# - no (the default): RTD3 power management is disabled.
# - coarse: the card only goes to low-power if no application is using it.
# - fine: the card is also allowed to go to low-power if applications are using it but have not
# actively submitted GPU work in some amount of time.
dynamic_power_management=fine

# The Nvidia driver handles power to the video memory separately from the rest of GPU.
# When dynamic_power_management=fine, this options controls the threshold of memory utilization
# (in Megabytes) under which the memory is put in a low-power state.
# Values over 200MB are ignored. Leave blank for the default (200MB).
# Setting this value to 0 keeps the memory powered at all times.
